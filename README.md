# minfit: A Minimalistic Fitness Tracker

minfit is a minimalistic fitness tracker designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Workout app on the iPhone.

## How Does it Work?

1. **Start the Timer**: Begin your workout session by starting the timer.
2. **Workout**: Engage in your chosen exercise routine.
3. **Stop the Timer**: Once your workout is complete, stop the timer.

And that's all there is to it!

- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend build tool that provides instant server startup.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that enables clients to request only the data they need.
- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented NoSQL database for storing workout data.

## Aren't There Plenty of Workout Trackers Out There?

Indeed, there are numerous workout trackers available, but I couldn't find one that met my specific needs. Most existing fitness trackers offer a plethora of features, whereas I simply wanted a straightforward tool for tracking my workouts. Thus, I decided to develop minfit, a minimalistic solution tailored to my requirements.
